## Problem 1

Instacart is an online grocery service that allows people in NYC to shop
online from local stores. The “instacart” dataset contains contains
1,384,617 observations, where each observation represents a product from
an order. There are 15 variables for each observation:  
order\_id: order identifier product\_id: product identifier
add\_to\_cart\_order: order in which each product was added to cart
reordered: 1 if this prodcut has been ordered by this user in the past,
0 otherwise user\_id: customer identifier eval\_set: which evaluation
set this order belongs in (Note that the data for use in this class is
exclusively from the “train” eval\_set) order\_number: the order
sequence number for this user (1=first, n=nth) order\_dow: the day of
the week on which the order was placed order\_hour\_of\_day: the hour of
the day on which the order was placed days\_since\_prior\_order: days
since the last order, capped at 30, NA if order\_number=1 product\_name:
name of the product aisle\_id: aisle identifier department\_id:
department identifier aisle: the name of the aisle department: the name
of the department

The key variable we will use for the following analysis is “aisle”.

``` r
data("instacart")
```

How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  rename(count = n)
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                          count
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ... with 124 more rows

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  rename(count = n) %>% 
  filter(count > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(
    aisle = factor(aisle),
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, count)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = count, y = aisle)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) +
  xlab("Number of Items") + ylab("Aisles") +
  labs(title = "Top 39 Aisles Number of Items Ordered For Each Aisle")
```

aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
fruits”, Including the number of times each item is ordered.

The following human-readable table shows the mean hour of the day at
which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of
the week.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarise(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

| product\_name    |        0 |        1 |        2 |        3 |        4 |        5 |        6 |

## Problem 2

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a continuous,
state-based surveillance system that collects information about
modifiable risk factors for chronic diseases and other leading causes of
death. BRFSS data can be used to identify emerging health problems,
establish and track health objectives, and develop and evaluate public
health policies and programs.

The brfss\_smart2010 dataset contains 134,203 observations and 23
variables, from year 2002 to year 2010. There is information on
location, topic, question, response, and response number of each
observation. The data is structured so that each (multiple-choice)
response to each question is a separate row.

Data cleaning:  
Format the data to use appropriate variable names;  
Focus on the “Overall Health” topic;  
Include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”;  
Organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to
“Excellent”.

``` r
brfss_clean = 
  brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  separate(locationdesc, into = c('state', 'location'), sep = ' - ') %>%
  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent"))) %>%
  arrange(response) %>% 
  #filter(response == "Excellent"  | response == "Very good" | response == "Good" | response == "Fair" | response == "Poor") %>% 
  select(-locationabbr, -class, -topic,  -question, -c(confidence_limit_low:geo_location))

brfss_clean %>% view()
```

``` r
states_2002 = brfss_clean %>% 
  filter(year == "2002") %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  distinct(location) %>% 
  count(state) %>% 
  filter(n >= 7)
states_2002
```

    ## 12 SC        7
    ## 13 TX       16
    ## 14 WA       10

These states were observed at 7 or more locations in 2002: CT, FL, MA,
NC, NJ, PA  
In 2010: CA, CO, FL, MA, MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, TX, WA

Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data\_value
across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average
value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing a line for
each state across years – the geom\_line geometry and group aesthetic
will help).

viridis::scale\_color\_viridis( name = “State”, discrete = T )

``` r
topResponses_info = brfss_clean %>% 
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>% 
  group_by(state, year) %>% 
  summarise(mean_dataValue = mean(data_value, na.rm = T)) 
```
